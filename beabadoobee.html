    <p>Beatrice Kristi Laus, or Bea, goes by the name Beabadoobee professionally, and her band also goes by the name beabadoobee (stylized in all lowercase).
        She's a British-Filipino indie/alternative/bedroom-pop singer-songwriter who started making music in 2017, and is today under the independent label "Dirty Hit".

    <p>Vrielle discovered Bea and her band during quarantine, when her very first song "Coffee" (released in 2017), suddenly blew up across social media,
        especially on TikTok. Since then, she's listened to every single album, EP, and singles she's released, and is long awaiting
        the day she can see her and her band live in concert.

    <p>What drew Vrielle to Bea was not only the fact that she's Filipina but also the way she could really relate to the messages and 
        emotions present in all of her songs. Bea's music helped Vrielle feel less alone and as if no one was experiencing the 
        same emotions she was during isolation.
